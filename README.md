# Preventing Sybil Attacks in Your Social Media App

To protect your social media app from Sybil attacks, consider implementing the following measures:

## 1. Strengthen Account Verification
### Email Verification
- Use domain checks to block disposable email addresses (e.g., services like Mailinator).

### Phone Number Verification
- Require users to verify their accounts with a phone number (SMS or OTP-based).

### Multi-Factor Authentication (MFA)
- Add an extra layer of authentication during account creation and login.

---

## 2. CAPTCHA Integration
- Use CAPTCHA (e.g., reCAPTCHA v3) during account creation to prevent automated bots.

---

## 3. Rate Limiting and Throttling
- Limit the number of accounts that can be created from a single IP address within a specific time frame.
- Throttle repetitive actions like posting, commenting, or liking to prevent bot-like behavior.

---

## 4. Behavioral Analysis
- Monitor user behavior to detect suspicious activity patterns:
  - Excessive likes, comments, or follows within a short period.
  - Repeated identical actions.
- Flag or restrict accounts exhibiting such patterns.

---

## 5. Identity Verification
### Government-Issued ID Verification
- Require government-issued ID for account verification in cases where additional authenticity is necessary (e.g., influencer accounts).

### Video Verification
- Use video verification or liveness detection for high-value accounts.

---

## 6. AI and Machine Learning
- Use algorithms to detect anomalies in user behavior.
- Train models to identify patterns typical of bots or fake accounts.

---

## 7. Limit API Access
- Secure your APIs with proper authentication (e.g., OAuth2).
- Implement rate-limiting and IP whitelisting/blacklisting for APIs.

---

## 8. Device Fingerprinting
- Track devices to identify and block multiple accounts created from the same device.
- Use browser fingerprinting to detect duplicate registrations.

---

## 9. Community Reporting
- Allow users to report suspicious accounts or activities.
- Implement moderation tools to review and act on reports.

---

## 10. Monitor Proxies and VPNs
- Use services to detect and block traffic from known proxy servers, VPNs, or TOR nodes.
- Flag accounts repeatedly accessing the app from such sources.
